# 2024 Fall Learning Analytics Hackathon
Welcome to the 10th Learning Analytics hackathon. This year, the goal is for you to find creative ways to use Canvas discussion data to improve the teaching or learning experience. Imagine you had data that represented all of the discussion activity in a Canvas course â€“ what would you build?

## Before the Hackathon
* Please **[register](https://events.ctlt.ubc.ca/events/2024-fall-learning-analytics-hackathon/)** for the hackathon if you haven't ready done so.
* Find a team (we suggest at least 3 per team, with a **maximum of 5**) (you will sign up your team in Canvas once we send the enrolment link). Individual team members **should all register for the event!** 
* Review the challenge details, data, and other materials (to be provided in Canvas at least 2 weeks before the event) 
* Some details are still being planned, and we will communicate after registration 

## ðŸ“… Schedule
### Saturday October 19th
* 9:00am - Doors open (Coffee and light refreshments provided)
* 9:30am to 10am - Welcome and Overview 
* 10am to Noon - Start Hacking
* 12pm to 1pm - Lunch (provided)
* 1pm to 4pm - Keep Hacking
* 4pm to 5pm - Work on presentations (Dinner provided!)
* 5pm - Presentations Start
* 7pm - End of Hackathon!

## ðŸ”¨ What You'll Build
The discussions in Canvas are rich with content that serve as a great data source for learning analytics, allowing educators, researchers, and intelligent hackathon participants to analyze student engagement, collaboration, sentiment, learning progress, among other factors to help improve teaching and learning. Your task is to build something that can be used to analyze and make sense of this discussion data. 

## Where to start
You can decide with your team what programming languages and frameworks/libraries to work with. If you need somewhere to get started, check out these two starter kits that we created: 
* [Getting Started with the Canvas API with Node.js/JavaScript](https://github.com/ubc/getting-started-with-the-canvas-api-with-node)
* [Getting Started with the Canvas API with Python](https://github.com/ubc/getting-started-with-the-canvas-api-with-python)

## ðŸ“š What You'll Learn
By participating in this hackathon, you'll learn to:

* use the [Canvas API](https://canvas.instructure.com/doc/api/)
* explore the data that [Canvas collects from you](https://learninganalytics.ubc.ca/ethics-policy/students-learning-analytics-and-privacy/)
* contribute to [open source projects](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects) (like this hackathon!)
* apply data analytics and programming skills
* work in a team
* build cool stuff!

## ðŸ¤” Ask For Help
Please ask the volunteers and your peers for help. We're all here to learn together!

## Final Submission
1. Update the `final_submission_template.md` that is inside your group's folder. 
1. Create a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) from your forked repo to the [original repo](https://github.com/UBC-LA-Hackathon/hack-la-2023).
1. Your pull request will be merged after it is reviewed.
